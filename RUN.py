# 1. RUN THE RECORDDATA.PY TO RECORD THE GAME PLAY AT 20-30 FPS (BETTER THAN RECORDING AT 40-60 FPS)
#    ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS AND SETTINGS CAN BE FOUND ON RECORDDATA.PY
#    MORE THAN 500 FILES AT 2000 FRAMES PER FILE OF RECORDED GAMEPLAY AT 20-30 FPS IS ENOUGH TO TRAIN A GOOD DRIVING MODEL

# 2. IF THERE ARE DIRTY DATA FILES WITH DISTURBANCES WHICH YOU WANT TO REMOVE / CLEAN THOSE FILES THEN USE THE Dcleaner.py TO
#    GO THROUGH EACH FILE FRAME BY FRAMES AND TRIM OUT UNWANTED PARTS / FRAMES FROM THESE FILES AND SAVE THE CLEANED FILES TO A
#    SEPERATE FOLDER DIRECTORY
#    Dcleaner.py IS LIKE EDITING A VIDEO TO FIND UNWANTED PARTS BY REWINDING , PLAYING FORWARD , SKIPING AND TRIMING OUT UNWANTED PARTS.

# 3. processdata.py WILL BE USED TO CHANGE LABELS FROM THE FORMAT [0,1,0,1] TO THE REQUIRED FORMAT [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
#    WHERE [ W, A, S, D ,WA,WD,SA,SD,NONE ]
#    THEN THE LABELED DATA IS BALANCED WITH A CALCULATED BALANCING RATIO WHERE NUMBER OF W,WA,WD DATA ELEMENTS ARE 1.5 TIMES
#    GREATER THAN THE REST OF THE LABELS
#    HERE THE COLLECTED DATA WHICH IS IN .NPY FORMAT IS SAVED IN .TFRECORD FORMAT AT SAVE_PROCESSED_DATA_FILEPATH

# 4. USE getlabelinfo2 TO GET THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LABELS FROM THE BALANCED DATA FILES
#    THIS WAY WE CAN KEEP TRACK OF HOW OUR LABELS ARE BEING BALANCED AND TO CHECK IF THERE IS NO HIGHLY IMBALANCED LABELS
